#AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT: writing linear search program by using recursive function.
#LINEAR SEARCH: This search is use to find key element in given array  if key element is present it prints key element.
#RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS: This basis of recursion is functions is to make the task simple and that the functions doesn’t make further calls
# PROCEDURE: 
1.Unlike iterative recursive doesn’t repeat the loop either it does call functions and make the code easy and make it effective
2.First we have to take an array i.e. a[] = {12,61,33,92,36,3,29,,98,54,60}
3.By using for loop iterate the loop ,to iterate the loop consider a variable “i”. i.e. for(i=0; i<=n; i++)
Where n is element index of last element.
4.Then, if the element is found its prints position of key element.
5.If the value of ” a” reaches greater than n it returns -1 to main function.
6.In the main function declare variables and scan the value of element.
7.If value of index is -1 then it prints “element is not found”.
8.Else print the index of element as output.
#INPUT:  
            12
            100
#OUTPUT:
                 4
                 Element not found
