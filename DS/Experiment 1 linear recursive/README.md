# AIM OF EXPERIMENT: writing linear search program by using recursive function.
# LINEAR SEARCH:  This search is use to find key element in given array  if key element is present it prints key element.
#RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS: The basis of recursion is functions is to make the task simple and that the function doesn't make further calls.
#PROCEDURE: First we have to take an array i.e. a[] = {12,61,33,92,36,3,29,,98,54,60}
By using for loop iterate the loop ,to iterate the loop consider a variable “i”. i.e. for(i=0;i<=n;i++)
Where n is element index of last element.
Then ,if the element is found its prints position of key element.
If the value  of” i”  reaches greater than n it returns -1 to main function.
In the main function declare variables and scan the value of element.
If value of index is -1 then it prints element is not found
Else  print the index of element as output.
INPUT:
            36
              100
OUTPUT:
                 5
                 SEARCH IS UNSUCCESSFUL
