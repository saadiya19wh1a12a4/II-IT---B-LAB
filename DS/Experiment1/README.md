#AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT : Writing linear search program by using iterative funtions(non recursive funtions).
#LINEAR SEARCH : This search is used to find the presence of the key element in the given array if present then the position of the key element in the given array.(by comparing each element present in the array to the key element).
#PROCEDURE : 
First we have to take the given array which constists of 10 elements i.e. a[i] = [12, 61, 33, 92, 36, 3, 29, 98, 54,60].
The first element position is considered as "m" which is "0" and the last element position is "n" which is "9".
